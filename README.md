# Airline-Management-System

## Introduction
Airline Management System is a solely PHP based application. It provides a user an easier way to access the system and is user friendly. This system helps the user book a flight and delete ine at the same time. There are many more functionalities to this system that are performed.

## Platform Used
For Project building: <br />
<ul>
  <li>VS Code</li>
</ul>

For UI Testing: <br />
<ul>
  <li>Test Project Agent</li>
</ul>

## Language Used
PHP - for building project and testing.

## Project Management Process
For managing the project among the team members, we have used a platform called <a href = "https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=93058444980&campaign=9124878606&creative=542638212437&device=c&keyword=jira&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p51242181056&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV54FMpErLH5Jgo314rOQHW3n7dkuAjC-4X7R0S0tH79P90Hed7T3XUaAnRnEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Jira</a> provided by <a href = "https://www.atlassian.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=99178947294&campaign=9869842034&creative=431933448859&device=c&keyword=atlassian&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53277688150&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001530700&ds_e1=GOOGLE&utm_medium=paid-search&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV5v1LvwFPL3o2tqqYYQymzSiB6NgDGYZcL7fitbVKnip-NruS7waV4aAm18EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Atlassian</a>.
<ul>
  <li>The team members, namely Scrum master, developer and tester, are assigned the tasks to be performed using the Jira platform by the scrum master.</li>
  <li>A sprint will be created as per the scrum master's will to check and progress through the project construction.</li>
  <li>Constant meets are held to monitor the progress of the project.</li>
</ul>
Testing
<ul>
  <li>The testing is divided into 4 divisions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Boundary Value Testing</li>
      <li>Unit Testing</li>
      <li>UI Testing</li>
      <li>Static Code Analysis Testing</li>
    </ul>  
  <li>Unit testing and Boundary value testing are done with the help of PHP and another additional library called vendor.</li>
  <li>UI testing is performed in collaboration with <a href = "https://testproject.io/">Test Project Agent</a>.</li>
  <li>Perform RIP routing protocol</li>
  <li>Perform VLAN protocol</li>
  <li>Check for the Routing Algortihm</li>
</ul>  

## Important Attributes
<ul>
  <li>The subnetting performed in the case study is not continuous as the sscale of the network considered is very small. The joining of employees is very indefinite. To maintain clarity in the division of IP addresses, continuous subnetting is being dodged.</li>
  <li>Routers are assigned with class A IP addresses<br />
      Remaining devices are assigned with class C IP addresses</li>
  <li>Nodes are being recorded. Refer the <a href = "https://github.com/Rhuthvik-D/Carpooling-System-Networking-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Carpooling%20Booking%20System.pdf">Documnetation</a></li>
  <li>Refer the <a href = "https://github.com/Rhuthvik-D/Carpooling-System-Networking-Project/tree/main/Sliding%20Window%20Protocol">Sliding Window Protocol</a> used</li>
</ul>

## Protocols Implemented
<ul>
  <li>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>FTP - File Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>DNS - Domain Name System</li>
</ul>


## Conclusion
The packet file that was shown is just reduced to a programmable scale. There can be any number of hosts as well as subnets. We have implemented all the necessary basic and routing protocols that are majorly necessary. The basic conditions that are required in our case study have been achieved. Cloud Virtualisation has been described in detailed as well as Selective repeat algorithm with respect to our case study. Socket programming has been done in Python language along with multi-threading. In this network, the basic condition, that is no two drivers can communicate among themselves, has been shown with the help of VLAN.
